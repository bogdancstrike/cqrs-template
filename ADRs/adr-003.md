# **ADR 003: Choice of PostgreSQL for the Write Model (Event Store)**

## **Status**

Accepted

## **Context**

The Alert Management System, using Event Sourcing, requires a durable and reliable database to store the sequence of events (the event store). This event store is the single source of truth for the state of all aggregates. The chosen database must support transactional writes to ensure atomicity when appending events and potentially snapshots. It should also be performant enough to handle the expected write load.

Axon Framework provides several options for event store implementations, including JPA-based stores, JDBC-based stores, and dedicated solutions like Axon Server or MongoDB.

## **Decision**

We will use **PostgreSQL** as the relational database for the write model, specifically to host the Axon Framework's JPA-based Event Store.

## **Consequences**

### **Positive:**

* **Relational Integrity and ACID Compliance:** PostgreSQL is a mature, open-source RDBMS known for its reliability, data integrity, and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. This is crucial for an event store, which is the system's source of truth.  
* **Transactional Support:** PostgreSQL offers robust transactional capabilities, essential for atomically appending events and snapshots as managed by Axon's JPA Event Store.  
* **Maturity and Community Support:** PostgreSQL has a large, active community, extensive documentation, and a proven track record in production environments.  
* **Cost-Effective:** Being open-source, PostgreSQL has no licensing costs.  
* **JPA Compatibility:** Axon Framework provides a JpaEventStorageEngine that works seamlessly with JPA, allowing us to leverage familiar ORM concepts and Spring Data JPA for configuration. This simplifies integration.  
* **Rich Feature Set:** PostgreSQL offers advanced features like JSONB support (useful for storing event payloads if not serialized to byte arrays), indexing capabilities (for tracking tokens or specific event metadata if needed), and good performance characteristics.  
* **Operational Familiarity:** Many organizations have existing expertise in managing and operating PostgreSQL databases.  
* **Testcontainers Support:** PostgreSQL is well-supported by Testcontainers, facilitating reliable integration testing.

### **Negative:**

* **Relational Overhead (Minor):** While flexible, using a relational database for an event store (which is essentially an append-only log) might have slightly more overhead compared to specialized event store databases. However, Axon's JPA implementation is optimized for this.  
* **Scalability Considerations:** While PostgreSQL can scale well (e.g., with read replicas, partitioning), scaling a single relational database for extremely high write throughput might eventually require more complex strategies compared to some NoSQL databases designed for horizontal scaling. For the anticipated load of the Alert Management System, this is not an immediate concern.  
* **Schema Management:** The tables for events, snapshots, and tracking tokens are managed by Axon, but underlying database schema changes (if any were needed outside Axon's scope) would require standard RDBMS schema migration practices.

## **Alternatives Considered**

1. **Axon Server:** A dedicated, zero-configuration event store and message router provided by AxonIQ.  
   * Pros: Optimized for Axon Framework, provides event routing, easy to set up, offers clustering in its Enterprise version.  
   * Cons: Introduces another component to manage. Standard Edition is free, but Enterprise features (clustering, multi-context) are commercial. For this project, we aim to use open-source components where feasible for core persistence.  
2. **MongoDB:** A NoSQL document database that can also be used for an Axon event store.  
   * Pros: Schema flexibility, good horizontal scalability for high write volumes.  
   * Cons: Different consistency model than RDBMS. Less familiarity within the team compared to PostgreSQL. Transactional support across documents can be more complex to reason about than RDBMS transactions, though Axon's MongoDB extension handles this.  
3. **JDBC Event Store (with PostgreSQL or other RDBMS):** Using Axon's JdbcEventStorageEngine directly.  
   * Pros: Potentially slightly more performant than JPA due to less abstraction.  
   * Cons: Less abstraction means more manual configuration of SQL statements if customization is needed. JPA is generally well-integrated with Spring Boot and offers a good balance.  
4. **Apache Kafka as Event Store (Anti-pattern for primary store):** Using Kafka itself as the primary event store.  
   * Pros: Kafka is already used for event input.  
   * Cons: Kafka is designed as a durable message log, not a database for random access or querying specific aggregate event streams efficiently. It lacks features for snapshotting and strong consistency guarantees needed for an event store in the Axon context. It's better suited as an event bus.

## **Justification**

PostgreSQL provides a robust, reliable, and transactionally consistent foundation for the Axon JPA Event Store. Its maturity, open-source nature, strong community support, and excellent integration with the Java ecosystem (via JDBC/JPA) make it a suitable choice for the write model of the Alert Management System. The benefits of ACID compliance and data integrity are paramount for the event store. The operational familiarity and Testcontainers support are also significant advantages. While specialized event stores exist, PostgreSQL offers a good balance of features, reliability, and ease of integration for this project's scale.
