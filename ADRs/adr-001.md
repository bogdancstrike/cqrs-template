# **ADR 001: Choice of Axon Framework for CQRS/ES Implementation**

## **Status**

Accepted

## **Context**

The Alert Management System requires a robust architecture to handle incoming alert messages, process them, store them durably, and provide a flexible query mechanism. Key architectural patterns identified as beneficial are Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing (ES). CQRS allows for scaling and optimizing the write and read sides independently, while Event Sourcing provides a full audit trail, temporal queries, and the ability to rebuild state.

Implementing CQRS and ES from scratch can be complex, error-prone, and time-consuming. It involves managing command dispatching, event handling, event storage, aggregate lifecycle management, and projections. A framework that simplifies these aspects is highly desirable.

## **Decision**

We will use **Axon Framework** as the primary framework for implementing CQRS and Event Sourcing patterns in the Alert Management System.

## **Consequences**

### **Positive:**

* **Accelerated Development:** Axon provides abstractions and components for aggregates, command handlers, event handlers, event store, command bus, event bus, and query bus. This significantly reduces boilerplate code and allows developers to focus on business logic.  
* **Best Practices Embodied:** Axon Framework is designed around DDD, CQRS, and Event Sourcing principles, guiding developers towards a well-structured application.  
* **Scalability:** Axon supports distributed environments, allowing different components (command handlers, event processors) to be scaled independently. It integrates well with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud for distributed setups.  
* **Pluggable Event Store:** Axon allows various implementations for the event store (JPA, JDBC, Axon Server, MongoDB), providing flexibility. For this project, we've chosen PostgreSQL via JPA.  
* **Snapshotting:** Axon provides mechanisms for aggregate snapshotting, which can optimize load times for aggregates with long event histories.  
* **Saga Support:** For managing complex business transactions that span multiple aggregates or bounded contexts, Axon offers robust Saga support. While not explicitly in the initial scope, this is a valuable feature for future extensions.  
* **Developer Ecosystem and Community:** Axon has a mature ecosystem, good documentation, and an active community, which is beneficial for support and learning.  
* **Location Transparency:** Axon handles the routing of commands and queries to the appropriate handlers, whether they are local or remote, simplifying distributed deployments.  
* **Event Processors:** Axon's event processors (Tracking and Subscribing) provide powerful and flexible ways to handle events for updating read models or triggering other actions. Tracking processors offer resilience and replay capabilities.

### **Negative:**

* **Learning Curve:** While Axon simplifies CQRS/ES, there is still a learning curve associated with the framework itself and the underlying patterns.  
* **Opinionated:** Axon is opinionated about how CQRS/ES should be implemented. This can be a constraint if specific, non-standard approaches are required.  
* **Complexity Overhead:** For very simple CRUD applications, Axon might introduce unnecessary complexity. However, the Alert Management System is expected to grow in complexity, justifying the use of Axon.  
* **Dependency:** The project becomes dependent on the Axon Framework and its release cycle.

## **Alternatives Considered**

1. **Custom Implementation:** Building CQRS/ES infrastructure from scratch.  
   * Pros: Full control, no external dependencies.  
   * Cons: High development effort, risk of errors, maintenance burden, reinventing the wheel.  
2. **Other CQRS/ES Libraries/Frameworks:** (e.g., Spring MediatR-like libraries, Akka)  
   * Pros: Might be lighter-weight for specific use cases.  
   * Cons: May not offer the same comprehensive feature set as Axon, particularly around event sourcing, distributed tracing, and saga management. Akka is powerful but brings in the actor model, which is a different paradigm.  
3. **Eventuate Tram:** Another event sourcing and transactional messaging framework.  
   * Pros: Strong focus on microservices and transactional outbox patterns.  
   * Cons: Different focus than Axon's DDD-centric approach. Might be more complex for the specific needs of this project.

## **Justification**

Axon Framework provides the most comprehensive and mature solution for implementing DDD, CQRS, and Event Sourcing within a Spring Boot environment. Its benefits in terms of development speed, adherence to best practices, and scalability outweigh the learning curve and the introduction of a new framework dependency for a system of this nature. The ability to integrate with Kafka for event transport and use PostgreSQL for the event store aligns with our technology choices.
