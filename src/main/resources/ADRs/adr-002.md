# **ADR 002: Adoption of CQRS and Event Sourcing Patterns**

## **Status**

Accepted

## **Context**

The Alert Management System is expected to handle a significant volume of incoming alert data (commands) and provide flexible, performant querying capabilities for various analytical and operational purposes (queries). Traditional N-tier architectures with a single model for both writes and reads can face challenges in such scenarios, including:

* **Model Complexity:** A single model optimized for writes (e.g., normalized for transactional consistency) may not be optimal for reads (e.g., denormalized for query performance), leading to compromises.  
* **Scalability Mismatch:** Write and read workloads often have different characteristics and scaling requirements. Scaling a monolithic system can be inefficient.  
* **Performance Bottlenecks:** Complex queries on a transactional database can impact write performance and vice-versa.  
* **Limited Historical Insight:** Traditional state-oriented persistence often overwrites data, making it difficult to reconstruct past states or understand the history of changes to an entity.

## **Decision**

We will adopt the **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)** pattern and the **Event Sourcing (ES)** pattern for the Alert Management System.

* **CQRS:** We will separate the command side (handling state changes) from the query side (handling data retrieval). The command side will focus on processing commands and emitting events, while the query side will build and maintain optimized read models from these events.  
* **Event Sourcing:** Instead of storing the current state of entities, we will store a sequence of state-changing events that have occurred. The current state of an aggregate will be derived by replaying these events.

## **Consequences**

### **Positive:**

* **Optimized Models:**  
  * **Write Model (Command Side):** Can be designed for transactional consistency and business rule enforcement, focusing on aggregates and domain logic.  
  * **Read Model(s) (Query Side):** Can be tailored specifically for query needs, denormalized, and potentially using different persistence technologies (e.g., Elasticsearch for text search, time-series DB for trend analysis). This project will use Elasticsearch.  
* **Improved Scalability:** The command and query sides can be scaled independently based on their specific load profiles.  
* **Enhanced Performance:** Queries on the read side do not impact the write side, and read models can be highly optimized for specific query patterns.  
* **Rich Audit Trail:** Event Sourcing naturally provides a complete, immutable history of all changes, which is invaluable for auditing, debugging, and business intelligence.  
* **Temporal Queries:** It's possible to reconstruct the state of an aggregate at any point in time.  
* **Flexibility in Read Models:** New read models can be created from the event stream to support new query requirements without affecting existing systems. Old read models can be rebuilt if their structure changes.  
* **Resilience:** Events can be replayed to rebuild read models or recover from failures.  
* **Decoupling:** The command side produces events, and various consumers (projectors for read models, other services) can react to these events independently.

### **Negative:**

* **Increased Complexity:** CQRS and ES introduce a higher level of architectural complexity compared to traditional CRUD approaches. This includes managing eventual consistency.  
* **Eventual Consistency:** Read models are updated asynchronously based on events, leading to eventual consistency. This means there might be a slight delay between a command being processed and the read model reflecting the change. This needs to be acceptable for the use cases. For alert management, a slight delay in search results is generally acceptable.  
* **Learning Curve:** Developers need to understand the principles of CQRS, ES, DDD, and eventual consistency.  
* **Event Schema Evolution:** Managing changes to event structures (event versioning) over time requires careful planning.  
* **Tooling and Infrastructure:** Requires appropriate tooling and infrastructure (e.g., event store, message bus, framework like Axon).

## **Alternatives Considered**

1. **Traditional CRUD with a Single Model:**  
   * Pros: Simpler to implement for basic applications, well-understood.  
   * Cons: Faces scalability, performance, and model complexity issues for systems with distinct read/write patterns or a need for historical data, as outlined in the Context section.  
2. **CQRS without Event Sourcing:** Separating commands and queries but using traditional state-based persistence for the write model.  
   * Pros: Simpler than full ES, still allows for separate read/write scaling and optimized read models.  
   * Cons: Loses the benefits of a full audit trail, temporal queries, and the ability to easily rebuild/create new read models from an event log.  
3. **Read Replicas:** Using database read replicas to offload query traffic.  
   * Pros: Simpler to set up for some databases.  
   * Cons: Still uses the same data model for reads and writes, limiting optimization. Does not address the fundamental model complexity issue or provide event-sourcing benefits.

## **Justification**

For the Alert Management System, the benefits of CQRS and Event Sourcing – particularly the ability to have optimized read models (Elasticsearch), a full audit trail, and the flexibility to evolve query capabilities – significantly outweigh the added complexity. The nature of alerts (discrete events happening over time) maps well to the Event Sourcing model. The system is expected to grow, and these patterns provide a solid foundation for future scalability and feature development. The trade-off of eventual consistency is deemed acceptable for the primary query use cases.
