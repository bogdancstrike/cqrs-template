# **Domain Model Description \- Alert Management System**

This document describes the core domain concepts, entities, value objects, and aggregates for the Alert Management System.

## **1\. Core Concepts**

The primary purpose of the system is to manage **Alerts**. An alert represents a significant occurrence or piece of information that requires attention or action. Alerts are typically generated based on events or conditions detected in other systems.

## **2\. Bounded Context: Alerting**

The system operates within a single primary Bounded Context: **Alerting**. This context is responsible for the lifecycle of an alert, from its creation to its potential resolution or archival.

## **3\. Aggregate(s)**

### **3.1. Alert Aggregate**

* **Root Entity:** Alert  
* **ID:** alertId (UUID) \- Uniquely identifies an alert.

The Alert aggregate is the central piece of our domain model. It encapsulates the state and behavior related to a single alert. All changes to an alert's state are managed through this aggregate by processing commands and emitting domain events.

#### **Attributes of Alert Aggregate:**

* alertId: (UUID) Unique identifier.  
* severity: (Value Object: AlertSeverity) \- e.g., CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, INFO.  
* description: (String) A human-readable description of the alert.  
* source: (String) The system or component that originated the alert (e.g., "MonitoringSystemA", "KafkaInput-OrderService").  
* status: (Value Object: AlertStatus) \- e.g., ACTIVE, ACKNOWLEDGED, RESOLVED, CLOSED.  
* createdAt: (Timestamp) When the alert was first created in the system.  
* updatedAt: (Timestamp) When the alert was last modified.  
* acknowledgedAt: (Timestamp, optional) When the alert was acknowledged.  
* resolvedAt: (Timestamp, optional) When the alert was resolved.  
* details: (Value Object: AlertDetails \- Map\<String, Object\> or a structured VO) \- Additional contextual information about the alert (e.g., hostname, error code, metric values). This provides flexibility for various alert types.  
* assignee: (String, optional) User or team assigned to handle the alert.  
* notes: (List\<Value Object: AlertNote\>, optional) \- A list of notes or comments added to the alert during its lifecycle.

#### **Behaviors (Commands handled by Alert Aggregate):**

* CreateAlertCommand: Creates a new alert.  
  * Validations: Ensure required fields are present (severity, description).  
  * Emits: AlertCreatedEvent.  
* UpdateAlertCommand: Modifies certain attributes of an existing alert (e.g., description, severity, details).  
  * Validations: Alert must exist.  
  * Emits: AlertUpdatedEvent.  
* AcknowledgeAlertCommand: Marks an alert as acknowledged.  
  * Validations: Alert must be in an 'ACTIVE' status.  
  * Emits: AlertAcknowledgedEvent.  
* ResolveAlertCommand: Marks an alert as resolved.  
  * Validations: Alert must be 'ACTIVE' or 'ACKNOWLEDGED'.  
  * Emits: AlertResolvedEvent.  
* CloseAlertCommand: Closes an alert, typically after resolution or if it's deemed irrelevant.  
  * Validations: Alert can be in various states before closing (e.g., RESOLVED, or even ACTIVE if forced closed).  
  * Emits: AlertClosedEvent.  
* AddNoteToAlertCommand: Adds a note to the alert.  
  * Validations: Alert must exist.  
  * Emits: NoteAddedToAlertEvent.  
* AssignAlertCommand: Assigns the alert to a user or team.  
  * Validations: Alert must exist.  
  * Emits: AlertAssignedEvent.  
* DeleteAlertCommand: (Use with caution \- typically, alerts are closed, not hard-deleted from an event-sourced system. This might mean marking it as "deleted" or archiving). For this template, we'll assume it means a logical deletion or archival.  
  * Validations: Alert must exist.  
  * Emits: AlertDeletedEvent (or AlertArchivedEvent).

#### **Invariants (Business rules enforced by the Aggregate):**

* An alert must have a unique alertId.  
* An alert must have a severity and description.  
* An alert's status transitions must follow a defined lifecycle (e.g., cannot be resolved if not active or acknowledged).  
* createdAt is immutable once set.

## **4\. Value Objects**

Value Objects are immutable objects defined by their attributes, not by a unique ID.

* **AlertSeverity**:  
  * Attributes: level (Enum: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, INFO)  
  * Represents the severity level of an alert.  
* **AlertStatus**:  
  * Attributes: status (Enum: ACTIVE, ACKNOWLEDGED, RESOLVED, CLOSED, DELETED)  
  * Represents the current lifecycle status of an alert.  
* **AlertDetails**:  
  * Attributes: properties (Map\<String, String\> or Map\<String, Object\>)  
  * A flexible container for arbitrary key-value pairs providing context to the alert.  
  * Example: {"hostname": "server01", "metric": "cpu\_usage", "value": "95%"}.  
* **AlertNote**:  
  * Attributes: text (String), author (String), timestamp (Timestamp)  
  * Represents a comment or note added to an alert.

## **5\. Domain Events**

Domain Events represent significant occurrences within the domain that have already happened. They are named in the past tense.

* AlertCreatedEvent(alertId, severity, description, source, details, createdAt, initialStatus)  
* AlertUpdatedEvent(alertId, description, severity, details, updatedAt) (attributes that were updated)  
* AlertAcknowledgedEvent(alertId, acknowledgedBy, acknowledgedAt, newStatus)  
* AlertResolvedEvent(alertId, resolvedBy, resolutionDetails, resolvedAt, newStatus)  
* AlertClosedEvent(alertId, closedBy, closedAt, newStatus)  
* NoteAddedToAlertEvent(alertId, noteId, noteText, author, timestamp)  
* AlertAssignedEvent(alertId, assignee, assignedAt)  
* AlertDeletedEvent(alertId, deletedBy, deletedAt, newStatus) (or AlertArchivedEvent)

## **6\. External Inputs (leading to Commands)**

* **Kafka Input Message:** A message from an external system (e.g., monitoring tool, IoT device) published to a Kafka topic. This message contains data that will be transformed into a CreateAlertCommand.  
  * Expected fields (example): messageId, sourceSystem, severityLevel, messageText, eventTimestamp, additionalData (JSON object).  
  * The Kafka Consumer in the infrastructure layer is responsible for consuming these messages, validating them, and mapping them to a CreateAlertCommand.

## **7\. Ubiquitous Language**

* **Alert:** A notification of a significant event or condition.  
* **Severity:** The impact level of an alert (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info).  
* **Status:** The current stage in an alert's lifecycle (Active, Acknowledged, Resolved, Closed).  
* **Source:** The origin system or component of the alert.  
* **Details:** Specific contextual information accompanying an alert.  
* **Acknowledge:** To confirm receipt and awareness of an alert.  
* **Resolve:** To confirm that the underlying issue causing an alert has been addressed.  
* **Close:** To formally end the lifecycle of an alert.  
* **Projector:** A component that listens to domain events and updates a read model.  
* **Event Sourcing:** Persisting the history of changes (events) rather than just the current state.  
* **Aggregate:** A cluster of domain objects (entities and value objects) that can be treated as a single unit.

This domain model provides a foundation for implementing the Alert Management System. It will evolve as more specific business requirements are identified.
